# DroneProject
 - This is a project to control a drone with a mathematical equations and more :)
 - The drone is powered via a Raspberry Pi 2, v1.1
 - Intially the drone will follow a pre-determined math equation with **high** accuracy
 - The drone will be able to think on its' own and adjust to its' environment. Ex: Use the wind as an aid

### To Do
- Include an equation parser (Read equations from a text file)
- Include a 'menu' to select between options (Different equations or demos)
- Include a derivative calculator function
- Create a function to return the direction and speed of a equation at certain time values
- A lottttttt of physics math *To Do: Expand on the physics*
